<h2>Arithmetic operations</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In real life, we often perform <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An arithmetic operation in Java refers to mathematical calculations performed on numerical values using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). The modulus operator calculates the remainder of a division operation. Java supports various integer types, such as int and long, which can be used to perform these arithmetic operations. Arithmetic operations can also be compared using relational operators, such as greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), and equal to (==).">arithmetic operations</a>. They help us to determine the change from a purchase, calculate the area of a room, count the number of people in a queue, and so on.

The addition operation is denoted by the '+' symbol and can be applied to variables, literals, or a combination of both. When adding two numbers in Java, the result is determined by the data types of the operands, with integer addition producing an integer result and floating-point addition producing a floating-point result.">addition</a> <code class="language-java">+</code></p></li><li><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/20783" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, subtraction is a binary arithmetic operation that takes two operands and returns the difference between them. | It is represented by the '-' operator. The subtraction operation is performed between two values, and the result is obtained by subtracting the second operand from the first operand. The subtraction operation can be applied to both primitive and object data types, but the result will always be a value of the same data type as the operands.

Java provides several operators for manipulating individual bits of integer numbers, which are particularly important in lower-level programming such as device drivers, low-level graphics, network communication, and other areas where speed and efficiency are critical.
